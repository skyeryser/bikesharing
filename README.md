# Bike-sharing
## Overview
This analysis is part of a business proposal to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The dataset used in this project was collected in New York City in August 2008 as a part of the Citibike bike-sharing program. The data visualizations depict 4 key metrics of the New York bike-sharing program:
1. The number of trips for all customers and genders by the time of day and day of the week
2. The number of bike trips for every type of user and gender by the day of the week
2. The length of time that the bikes are being used by all customers and by gender
4. The start and end locations of bike trips around the city

## Results

During the work week, riders use Citybike rentals between 7 and 9 AM and 4 and 7 PM. On the weekend, rentals are spread out more evenly throughout the day.

Male subscribers are more likely to use the Citybike-sharing service than females and people of unknown gender.

Subscribers are more likely to use Citibike rentals than one-time riders. The most active days for subscribers to ride bikes are Thursdays and Fridays.

Citibike rides usually last fewer than 20 minutes and rarely surpass 40 minutes.

As depicted in previous visualizations, male ridership is the most prevalent, followed by unknown genders and females.

![06_starting_locations.png](https://github.com/skyeryser/bikesharing/blob/main/Photos/06_starting_locations.png)

Bike trips tend to start within a relatively contained area in the city. 

![07_ending_locations.png](https://github.com/skyeryser/bikesharing/blob/main/Photos/07_ending_locations.png)

Trips end in roughly the same area as they began. This pattern correlates with the relatively short average trip duration of fewer than 20 minutes per ride.

## Summary

Citibike ridership is primarily male subscribers that use the ride service for short rides within the city. Many bike trips during weekdays look to be part of daily work commute routines for people living and working in the city. On weekends, people steadily use the service throughout daylight hours. 

Launching a similar service in Des Moines, Iowa will be successful if the program is in an area with a dense population of people living within a 20-minute bike ride to work and leisure activities.
